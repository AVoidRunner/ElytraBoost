# ElytraBoost
An old plugin which gives boosts to players wearing Elytras, and holding a Glistering Melon Slice. Made for fun.

Starts boosting when player runs the "/yeet" command, and continues boosting as long as they're holding a Glistering Melon Slice.
You can change the power of the boost by running "yeetspeed".

If for some reason you're not getting launched, try moving. This is a very old plugin and was made with very a outdated methodology.
